Tetris Online System
Introduction
System Overview
The system is an online version of Tetris, designed with a client-server architecture. It allows users to play the game online, track personal statistics, and view others' stats. The interface is modern and intuitive, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Background and Motivation
Our school promotes computer-based learning. During breaks, my classmates played Tetris, a game I initially didn't understand. After learning it, I appreciated the strategic thinking it required. This project was chosen to combine client-server communication with strategic gameplay.

Objectives
Develop client-server communication: Enable users to connect, play Tetris, view stats, see connected users, and check the leaderboard.
Data storage and updating: Store and update player data in real-time.
User interface: Create a modern and intuitive UI.
Expected Challenges
Managing multiple simultaneous users.
Real-time data updates.
Designing an intuitive UI.
Ensuring system security.
Existing Solutions Review
